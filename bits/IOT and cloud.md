Evolution from hand to www to web 20 to socila media to machine to machine

Enterprise security is a comprehensive approach organizations use to protect their digital assets, data, systems, networks, and operations from unauthorized access, cyber threats, and physical risks. It encompasses a mix of technologies, strategies, policies, and user education aimed at maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and resources.

Key aspects of enterprise security include protecting data as it moves across networks (including remote offices and the internet), securing endpoints and devices, managing identity and access, deploying threat detection and automated response systems, and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. It also involves continuous monitoring, vulnerability management, incident response, and educating employees to recognize and handle security risks.

# Contact session 2

earlier security was external, 
non cloud based
multiple internal tools

now internal
cloud based
third party
BYOD

# NIST cybersecurity framework

operation > implementation changes > business level risk assement by risk managers> changes in future risk > executive level devision >  budget allocation > framework implementation

# Enterprice security architecture

## earlier
DMZ based

zone based, protocl based

## now
Advanced model > data risk


microarchitectures

architecture within architecture
fore example DMZ - MVC
 web or presentation
application or logic
database or data

virtualisation - allows all three in the same system

data centric approach mean that we protect the data > trust centric models

## Data risk arhitecture

Risk key factor of any security arhcitecture.

data needs to be generated stored and processed.

we need to protect data > in process network > in process systems > in process users who interact this is the trust model. > creat standards

## Architecture roadmap

1. Define users > define aplications > define data >  define rolse >  define processes > develop standards
