Dimensions of a cryptographic system

Operation
NUmber of keys
Processing method

hash functions
digital signature provide authenticationa dn integrity

kwy exchange protocols

random number generators

SSL/TLS for secure communications
IPSec for secure IP networking
PGP for email encryptions

by hash functions DLT systesm can create uniqe fixed length representation of data known asa hashes.

any attempt to alter the data within a block will result in a change in the hash

distributed sstem depend on public ke cryptography for authenictication adn authorisation.

consens mechanis. the are also use to make consesus, prrof of work , prrof of stake and byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) they all rely on cryptographic puzzles, cryptographic voting, r crytographic signing to enable decnrrealised decision making amd prevent malicious actores from manipulating the ledger.

privacy and confidentiaity is maintained of the sensiitive information. zero knowledge prrofs, homorphic encryption and ring signatures allow participants to prove teh validity of tranasactions or computations without revealing the underlying data, this preserving priicay and condifentiality

key managment and access control. this is necessary to prevent unauthorise daccess.

## Elliptic curve

y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
