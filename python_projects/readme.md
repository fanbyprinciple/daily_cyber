# autonomous battery operated micro aquatic board

The shortest path includes all the roads travelled only once. 
Help your autonomous battery-operated micro aquatic boat in finding such a path given a starting 
point and the map. 
Here the area map is represented as a graph. The algorithm takes the starting point and the graph 
as the input and produces the shortest path covering all the edges only once.

Use the following algorithms to solve the problem: 
1. Recursive Best First Search A* 
2. Hill climbing algorithm 
Answer the following:
